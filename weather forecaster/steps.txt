some dumb pseoudo code
dont read this i wrote it for myself as notes
1.import data
2.ask user what city they would like
3. train the data 
    - based on the city they choose
        - get longatude and latitude
    - get data based on location
    - look through data to make sure that data and weather each have a value associated with one another
    - once data is placed into arrays or lists, plot data
    - once data is plotted create recurssion algrithium to look through
        - if data and prediciton match the real life data, congrates the bot works, else its broken
    - use an AMRIA model to locate moving average
    - plot perdictions and home sweet home
